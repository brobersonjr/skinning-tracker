## Project Summary
WoW Midnight addon that tracks daily Renowned Beast skinning across profession skinner characters.
- Slash command: `/skt`
- GitHub: https://github.com/brobersonjr/skinning-tracker
- Users install via WowUp-CF using the GitHub link
- **Audience: English-only clients for now. No localization work needed.**

## Coding Conventions
- Lua only — no external dependencies beyond the WoW API and optional ElvUI
- Keep all color constants local to each file (C_GREEN, C_YELLOW, etc.)
- Use server time (`C_DateAndTime.GetServerTime()`) with a fallback to `time()`
- Widget reuse pattern: create once, show/hide on refresh — never create frames inside Refresh()
- Print all user-facing messages with the `|cff00ff96[SkinningTracker]|r` prefix

## Build/Development
- No build system — standard Lua addon
- Test in-game with `/reload` after changes
- Debug mode: `/skt debug`

## Reviewed Findings (2026-03-07)
A third-party agent flagged 6 issues. Assessment below — do not act on dismissed items.

| # | Finding | Decision | Reason |
|---|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Global namespace (`SkinningTracker` global) | **Dismiss** | Collision risk is negligible for this addon name |
| 2 | Hardcoded reset time (UTC 15) fails for EU servers | **Defer** | English/US-only audience for now; revisit if EU players adopt the addon |
| 3 | Multiple event frames | **Dismiss** | Standard WoW addon pattern, no real overhead |
| 4 | GUID parsing via `strsplit` | **Dismiss** | Format has been stable for years, works correctly |
| 5 | Hardcoded font `FRIZQT__.TTF` | **Dismiss** | This is the standard WoW font, always present |
| 6 | Loot localization | **Already fixed** | 1.3.3 uses `LOOT_ITEM_SELF` / `LOOT_ITEM_SELF_MULTIPLE` with proper escaping |
